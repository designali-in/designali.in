## Comparison

DIcons vs Lucide

DIcons is a inspiration of [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) Icons.

The decision to create Lucide arose from growing dissatisfaction with the moderation of the Lucide Icons project.

In an effort to expand the icon set while remaining true to the original minimalist design language, Designali is driven by a community of developers and designers.
We strive to grow together and maintain a faithful continuation of the project.

## Why should I choose DIcons over Lucide Icons?

- DIcons has expanded its icon set by 500+ in the last few days. DIcons now has over 10000+ icons, while Lucide has around 1500+ icons.
- Well maintained code base.
- Active designer.
