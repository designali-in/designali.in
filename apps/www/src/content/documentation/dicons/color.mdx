By default, all icons have the color value: currentColor. This keyword uses the element's computed text color value to represent the icon color.

## Example

```bash
import { Smile } from "dicons";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Smile color="#3e9392" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
