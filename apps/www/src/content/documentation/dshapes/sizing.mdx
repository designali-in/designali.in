By default, the size of all icons is 24px by 24px. The size is adjustable using the size prop and CSS.

## Example

```bash title="pnpm"
import { Abstract } from "dshapes";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Abstract size={64} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
