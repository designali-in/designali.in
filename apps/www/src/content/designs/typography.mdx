Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language
legible, readable, and visually appealing. It involves the selection of
typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and
letter-spacing (tracking), as well as adjusting the space between pairs of
letters (kerning). Typography plays a crucial role in both print and digital
media, influencing how text is perceived and how it communicates its message.

## Heading

- Font Style: Often bold, sans-serif, or serif typefaces are used. Headings are usually larger in size to stand out.
- Size: Heading sizes typically decrease as the heading levels increase (e.g., h1 > h2 > h3 >4).
- Weight: Bold or semi-bold to ensure prominence.
- Spacing: Adequate space above and below to separate from surrounding content.

## Paragraphs

- Font Style: Typically a serif or sans-serif font that is easy to read in longer blocks of text.
- Size: 12px to 16px, depending on the medium and audience.
- Weight: Regular or light for easy readability.
- Line Height (Leading): 1.5 to 1.75 times the font size to ensure good readability and avoid text crowding.
- Alignment: Left-aligned or justified.

## Lists (Bulleted and Numbered)

- Size: Slightly smaller than body text, or the same size, depending on the design.
- Spacing: Increased line height to distinguish between list items; space above and below the list.
- Indentation: Indented from the main text to visually separate the list from paragraphs.
